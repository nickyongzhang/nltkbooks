In contrast to feature extractors, which record features that have been automatically detected, we are now going to declare the features of words and phrases. We start off with a very simple example, using dictionaries to store features and their values."

    "So far, we have only seen feature values like sg and pl. These simple values are usually called **atomic** — that is, they can't be decomposed into subparts. A special case of atomic values are **boolean** values, that is, values that just specify whether a property is true or false. For example, we might want to distinguish **auxiliary** verbs such as can, may, will and do with the boolean feature AUX. For example, the production V[TENSE=pres, AUX=+] -> 'can' means that can receives the value pres for TENSE and + or true for AUX. There is a widely adopted convention which abbreviates the representation of boolean features f; instead of AUX=+ or AUX=-, we use +AUX and -AUX respectively. These are just abbreviations, however, and the parser interprets them as though + and - are like any other atomic value. \n",
